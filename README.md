            This is a girl of fifteen years who was killed in action.
            In her western tent she lies for the night with a patten of grass,
            And a sweet breath lies in her breast purse,
            And a cuckoo is asking for a crumpled note
            ...She has, by her element, no husband,
            And, though she has a husband prettier than herself,
            She is shut away from her homelands with the rust of her tears.
            
            A forest-goor with a forest-goor face,
            She lies awake and ponderous in the moon's light,
            While the stars move in the unbroken sky.
            ...The girl from Wu, from Liangzhou,
            Was very young when she and her friends,
            First came to the capital from Chu
            And have been almost all come in the last year.
            ...They all come from good families,
            Which makes me sad that they have ended this long life.
            But we women in green carriage with hoops for our soles
            Wept when our side of the house was burned,
            And when our chief was sent away, we said:
            What do you want from me, old friend?
            Nothing to see, nothing to hear today,
            For I have waited this long for you, a long way from me.
            ...When shall we meet again you there, when the trees finally fade?
            We ask where you are going,
            We ask when we come.
            ...I have known you long enough to be pure with us,
            You have known me long enough to be pure with you.
            ...You were so kind as to promise me the world,
            That I might give you ten beautiful songs;
            But you did not answer my summons, instead playing \"Ode to the Wind Moved the River.
            Oh, if only this Taihouan song were as true
            ...Oh, forgive my broken heart!
            The mountain-light of morning and evening is long gone,
            And our new friend, the quietude of a high official,
            Has, through his lady of the lake, entered the court of the mountain.
            
            Moved by the rapidity with which the court was built
            And the palace of the river-merchant
            That was once his palace, now he has a great gale.
            The jade courtier is once more a high point,
            With the silver screen red and gold;
            The silkworms are spreading their wings in satisfaction
            While the great artist's waves are tossing about the world.
            ...What are you thinking as we part from one another,
            Pulling in our horses for the stirrup-cups?
            We cry in the street to thank you, for your good offices.
            The road ahead is narrow and dangerous,
            With only a few crooked steps to your western tower.
            But the future is in our hands, and we hurry to launch you!
